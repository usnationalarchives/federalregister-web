# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  presidential_documents:
    processing_delay_note: This page contains documents that have been published in the Federal Register. Because the White House cannot deliver a document to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) until after the President signs a document, there is always a delay (of at least one day, typically of several days) between when the President signs a document and when it is published. Once received, OFR gives presidential documents priority processing and documents will appear on public inspection the business day before publication. If you are looking for a recently-signed Presidential document, you may wish to check the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions">website</a>.
